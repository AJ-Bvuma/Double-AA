# Double-AA
We present an application that uses object-detection to highlight and label different types of objects.
We at Double AA to the approach of using the applicstion for Agriculture means of teaching, educating and assisting farmer identify types of crops, foreign plant detection for removal and indicating on when the crop is ready for harvesting.
Due to time and complications we were unable to properly train our ML model to specifically detect on a singular group of assests (Vegetation)
Hence we used a default ML model to  hopefully give an idea of how a part of our application will operate

We more given time, resources and studying of teaching machine models we hope to release a final application free for use.
Our target market are students and workers in need of an application to assist them in farmers, yeild and agricultural workshops.
